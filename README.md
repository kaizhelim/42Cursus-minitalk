# 42Cursus-minitalk

The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals. 
It is an introductory project for the bigger UNIX projects that will appear later on in the cursus.

### Description
This project is just testing our understanding about signal handling.\
It is not a common application we will do in real world.\
We are creating a communication program in the form of a client and server.

| Server | Client |

| Launch the server and display its PID. | The client must then communicate the string passed as a parameter to the server. Once the string has been received, the server must display it. |
